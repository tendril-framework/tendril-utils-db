The Database Utils Module (:mod:`tendril.utils.db`)

This module provides utilities to deal with Tendril's Database. While the
actual functionality is provided by the :mod:`sqlalchemy` package, the
contents of this utility module simplify and specify the application code's
interaction with :mod:`sqlalchemy`
